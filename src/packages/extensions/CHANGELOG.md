## Unreleased

### Excalidraw Extensions

#### Features

- Render math notation using the MathJax library. Both standard Latex input and simplified AsciiMath input are supported. MathJax support is implemented as a `math` subtype of `ExcalidrawTextElement`.

  Also added plugin-like subtypes for `ExcalidrawElement`. These allow easily supporting custom extensions of `ExcalidrawElement`s such as for MathJax, Markdown, or inline code. [#5311](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5311).

- Provided a stub example extension (`./empty/index.ts`).
